# 🛠 Helm Self-Healing and Autoscaling

## 🌟 Project Overview
In this project, I have crafted a comprehensive solution for deploying web applications on Kubernetes, with a keen focus on resilience, scalability, and dynamic cloud-native deployments. By leveraging Helm charts, I have streamlined the application deployment process, utilizing Kubernetes' advanced features for self-healing, autoscaling, and ensuring high availability. 

## 📦 Key Components

### 🚀 Helm Chart Development
- **Web Application Stack**: I developed Helm charts for deploying web servers, application backends and databases.
- **Scalability and Health Checks**: I included configurations for automatic scaling, resource limits, and health checks, ensuring the system's optimal performance and stability.

### ⚖ Autoscaling
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: I implemented HPA for the web and application layers based on CPU and memory usage, ensuring efficient scaling.
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: I adjusted the number of nodes in the cluster based on demand, optimizing resource utilization.

### 💚 Self-Healing
- **Liveness and Readiness Probes**: I utilized Kubernetes probes to automatically restart unresponsive pods, maintaining service availability.
- **PodDisruptionBudgets**: I ensured minimum application availability during maintenance and voluntary disruptions.

### ⏪ Rollback and Version Control
- **Helm Release Versioning**: I implemented a strategy for managing Helm chart versions, allowing easy rollbacks to previous versions in case of deployment challenges.

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- **Automated Pipeline**: I established a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for comprehensive automation, including pre-deployment and post-deployment stability testing.

### 📊 Monitoring and Alerting
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: I integrated these tools for comprehensive monitoring of the application's health and performance, with alerting for critical metrics.
